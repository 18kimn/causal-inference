Most interesting academic questions are questions about
cause. Academics in the general case don't just seek to
understand _what_ is happening in some observed event, but
_how_ and _why_ it occurs. These two modifiers force us to
examine the causal relationship between observed phenomena,
often even when the word "cause" or other terms like
"affect" are omitted. In clarifying that causal relationship
or describing how one observation affects another, scholars
can expose an underlying phenomenon connecting two exterior
ones, forming a theory from symptoms.^[Some obligatory
caveats here: lots of academics are satisfied with
documenting the "what." You can do brilliant, advanced, and
theoretically challenging work simply by measuring or
describing something -- how many of group X is low-income,
where is COVID-19 spreading most rapidly, which group won
which battle -- without attempting to describe some
underlying phenomenon that drives it. Cause itself is an
infectious question that can find its way into these kinds
of topics, but it is worthwhile to simply create an archive
or reference material as well.]

This essay is an attempt to critique causality itself, a
concept scholars usually take for granted in favor of making
or critiquing claims of causality. I begin with a discussion
of the field of statistical causal inference, which I view
as having led the scholarly discussion in this topic for the
past thirty years. I generalize its major limitations and
issues to argue that any statement of causality is built
upon an alternate possibility or potential outcome, and that
an infinite portion of these possibilities are foreclosed by
the trajectory of history and racial capitalism. In doing
so, I attempt to outline the shape of scholary knowledge,
the force of cause that motivates much of it, and the
dimension of power that modifies how we know cause. Finally,
I give two examples to illustrate the application of this
line of thought, and conclude with a call to bring this
critique into the academy and the world.

What is causality? Most scholars accept what is known as the
"counterfactual" model for causality, which defines that _A_
causes _B_ if and only if _A_ were not to happen, then _B_
would not happen. That latter hypothetical scenario is
referred to as a _potential outcome_, and forms the crux of
a statistical model developed by Jerzy Neyman (1923) and
more famously by Donald Rubin (1974 and onwards).^[A general
discussion of the history of causality, including causality
arguments before the counterfactual model, can be found in
@sekhonCausality2011] In Rubin's words:

> Intuitively, the causal effect of one treatment, E, over
> another, C, for a particular unit and an interval of time
> from $t_1$ to $t_2$ is the difference between what would
> have happened at time $t_2$ if the unit had been exposed
> to E initiated at $t_1$ and what would have happened at
> $t_2$ if the unit had been exposed to C initiated at
> $t_1$: "If an hour ago I had taken two aspirins instead of
> just a glass of water, my headache would now be gone," or
> "Because an hour ago I took two aspirins instead of just a
> glass of water, my headache is now
> gone."^[@rubinEstimatingCausalEffects1974, p. 2]

Or the corresponding basic mathematical structure:

> Let y(E) be the value of Y measured at $t_2$ on the unit,
> given that the unit received the experimental Treatment E
> initiated at $t_1$; Let y(C) be the value of Y measured at
> $t_2$ on the unit given that the unit received the control
> Treatment C initiated at $t_i$; Then y(E) â€” y(C) is the
> causal effect of the E versus C treatment on Y for that
> trial, that is, for that particular unit and the times
> $t_1$, $t_2$.^[@rubinEstimatingCausalEffects1974, p. 2]

I'd like to go one step further than Neyman and Rubin.
Instead of only arguing that we can prove cause when we
prove a difference in potential outcomes, I posit that we
only know cause at all, even outside of statistical proofs,
when we believe in that difference in potential outcomes.
Whether we consciously think about the alternate
hypothetical outcome or not, we only ever know a causal
effect of event A on outcome B because we believe something
else would have happened if event A did not happen. In fact,
I'd say these are logically the same sentence.

---

But there is a glaring issue in the counterfactual approach,
which Rubin calls the "fundamental problem of causal
inference:" we only ever live in one version of events, one
timeline, one strand of history. We never actually know what
would happen if event A did not happen, even though we need
to in order to show that it causes effect B.

Statistics' main answer to this unavoidable dilemma has been
the development of techniques in both experimental design
and in observational studies to replicate, randomize, and
isolate causal effects. One can only know the single version
of events where a participant takes a treatment, so one
cannot compare it to the sequence of events where a
participant does not receive a treatment. But if a scientist
distributes a treatment randomly across many particpants,
they don't need to know the alternate timelines for each
participant, they can simply take the _average difference in
outcomes_ across the treatment and control group, and the
power of randomness and replication will ensure that any
observed outcome is a true measure of the treatment's
effect.^[It's not really relevant to this paper, but this
measurement is called the "average treatment effect," and
estimating it or its significance correctly is a large
portion of the field of statistical causal inference.]

Of course, you can't do so in nearly all settings outside of
the sciences. There are financial, logistical, and ethical
barriers to replicating, randomizing, and controlling
treatments, such that the "gold standard" of a randomized
experiment is simply not possible. Scholars have tried to
compensate for this in observational studies, through
finding settings where a condition was near-randomly applied
without any researcher's intention, attempting to compare
similar participants based on observable characteristics, or
using proxy variables better suited for psuedo-experimental
analysis as the "treatment" instead of the main variable of
interest.^[More commonly referred to as natural experiments,
propensity score matching and weighting, and instrumental
variables.] But the reality is that these fall short of most
questions related to cause, because they require assumptions
that are difficult to justify and often cannot be met. Even
when they are successfully applied, they are regretfully but
understandably looked down upon in their argumentative power
compared to experimental designs, because there may be
thousands of unobserved confounders; after all of your
efforts, you may still be studying a case of correlation,
not causation. And of course, the field of causal inference
as it stands is almost completely irrelevant for the
humanities and many social sciences simply because the kind
of data dealt with does not allow a single statistical test
to be performed. This is not to say that causal assertions
are not made in these fields, because as I began this essay
with observing, statements about cause form the core of most
academic work, but supposed "foolproof" methods for
asserting causality are simply not applicable to much of the
academy.

With this inescapable truth, I want to return to my above
observation that cause is invariably known through potential
outcomes, even without any researcher's intent. How can that
be possible? Despite having no way to know what happens in
that alternate timeline, and no way to compute the average
of many different randomized conditions and outcomes, how
can we infer cause? The short answer is that the
counterfactual is imagined. "Imagined" might seem like a
strange word, because we mostly don't consciously think of
that alternate reality when we assert a causal relationship.
I choose it because the way we know cause in the absence of
a strict scientific proof is almost by definition
subjective, relying on all of our qualitative and malleable
leanings in its construction. Our assertions for cause
depend on our belief that a different effect would be
produced if a situation began with a different cause, and
like all of our beliefs it has been formed by a host of
personal experience and social forces.

To clarify, the kind of imagination involved in the causal
assertion is not a momentary impulse we have. As I said
above, we don't think of that alternative reality when we
make a causal assertion, and it doesn't arise in our
subconscious in that instant either. Instead, over time a
belief in what could have been becomes ingrained into our
subconscious and into the fabric of our current reality,
through how we know history and time, through the images we
form of places around us, through the demographics and built
realities of our current social realities. These forces
serve to memorialize, preserve, and excavate certain forms
of knowledge, and other times to create gaps and let the ebb
of time wash history away -- all in line with the hierarchy
of power in our current social formation. Thus, just as how
the field of statistics often refers to the fundamental
problem of causal inference as a "missing data problem," the
erasure of these possibilities might be seen from the
perspective of the humanities as an archival problem of what
kinds of knowledge are preserved for future scholars to
study. But more than being "just" a methodological problem,
the fundamental problem of causal inference is just as much
a problem at large of the kinds of people, possibilities,
and futures are erased through the forces of war, genocide,
oppression, racism, and the dimension of power in general.
The alternate possibilties available to us to make the
causal assertion are built over time through an uncountable
number of agents that form structural forces, and an equally
uncoutable number of these possibilities are lost forever as
the course of history inevitably and invariably forgets what
could have been.

In her landmark work _The Intimacies of Four Continents_,
Lisa Lowe refers to the problem of "what could have been" as
the _past conditional temporality_, or a "space of a
different kind of thinking, a space of productive attention
to the scene of loss, a thinking with twofold attention that
seeks to encompass at once the positive objects and methods
of history and social science, and also the matters absent,
entangled, and unavailable by its
methods."^[@loweIntimaciesFourContinents2015] Drawing from
Stephanie Smallwood, David Eng, and David Kanzanijian, Lowe
views violent colonial removals from the archive alongside
the archive's disciplinary and geographic segmentations, all
of which she attempts to think across in her monograph.
Saidiya Hartman famously brings an analogous concept forth
in _critical fabulation_, "a critical reading of the archive
that mimes the figurative dimensions of history ... to tell
an impossible story and to amplify the impossibility of its
telling."^[@hartmanVenusTwoActs2008] We may think of the
many scholars and writers in science fiction and speculative
fiction, historians recovering lost or missing archives, and
those in ethnic studies and cultural studies participating
in that project of critical fabulation. They clarify those
alternative possibilities that our current hegemonic racial
formation tries hard to make impossible to imagine. In doing
so, they not only take on the project of reckoning with the
scale and extent of loss but also the impossible task of
describing how loss has affected the present.

This essay does not attempt to join that project through
archival recovery or speculation, but instead through
applying these scholars' line of thought to the domain of
causal inference and potential outcomes. I want to focus on
what I will call the _specter of alternate possibility_ --
that any causal assertion we make today has been and is
being shaped by realities that are no longer possible, which
at some point in history served a reference for a causal
assertion to be made, but only haunts our causal assertions
today. _Specter_ is partially inspired by Grace Cho's
_Haunting of the Korean Diaspora_, a history of the Korean
War and how its aftermath is felt through both material
reality and ghostly silences passed down for generations. I
also use it to bring forth Marx and Engel's famous assertion
from the _Communist Manifesto_ that a "specter is haunting
Europe -- the specter of communism," as well as Derrida's
revival of the metaphor and the coinage of "hauntology" in
_Specters of Marx_. What I want to gesture towards with
these references is not only the permanence and power of
loss, but alsothe paradoxical _presence_ of loss in how it
continually shapes our reality today, and to locate the type
of loss most relevant to the specter in the flow of power
within empire and racial capitalism.

To bring us back to a less lofty point and to argue for the
ghostly power of the specter, I want to consider some
examples of the specter's haunting. Alice Amsden writes in
_Asia's Next Giant_ (1992) that Korea fell to Japanese
colonization because it was "weak," relying on and reifying
a Western assessment of precolonial Korea as such in
comparison to South Korea's later period of
industrialization. But how do we know -- what would have
happened if Korea was "strong?" And might the problem
instead be located in Japan's imperial and capitalist
ambitions, or in a lack of allyship from troubled neighbors
Russia and China? The conclusion that Korea was conquered
because of some weakness is acceptable to Amsden because
Japan having an alternate set of goals is not a valid
alternate possibility. One cannot make a meaningful
statement that Korea was conquered because of Japan's
imperial ambitions because the ambitions are a plainly
obvious fact, an inexchangeable prior over which other
alternate possibilites are considered. We never really know
the outcome of the alternate possibilities listed above, for
we only have the timeline in which Korea was "weak," but
paying heed to the specter of alternate possibility and
asking _what if_ forces us to reexamine the assumptions over
which these kinds of causal conclusions are made, and how
the causal conclusion reinforces the assumption that
prefaced it.

Finally, though I began the discussion of the specter by
considering the cases in which randomized experiments are
not possible, I want to conclude by arguing that the social
construction of cause absolutely haunts experimental
settings. To give a small example, we might conduct a "gold
standard" of the randomized experiment to find that
individuals spending more time on their cell phones as
children exhibit diminished social skills, and conclude that
phones cause harm for child development. The experiment may
be entirely valid in its conclusions and methodology, and it
may provide a well-qualified argument for many parents to
lower screen time for their children. But we limit ourselves
in accepting its conclusions forthright as a statement of
phones as an abstract concept affecting health. What if the
past forty years had yielded a different kind of technology,
one that did not alienate us through endless streams of
content and advertising? Accepting this experiment's
conclusions of phones in the abstract or universal case
causing harm for child development is only possible if we
forget that alternative possibility, and conversely we
foreclose a revival of that alternative present in accepting
this experiment's conclusions as a reflection of the natural
world.

These are brief and trivial examples, but I hope they
illustrate the infectious nature of the specter, in both
settings where we make "unprovable" assertions of cause and
when we abide by the "gold standard" of the randomized
experiment. The forms of the arguments involved in these
examples are ubiquitous in scholarly knowledge, hinting at
opportunities to rethink causality everywhere. And just as
how the specter of alternative possibility is born through
losses both in the archive and in the world at large, to
release the specter from its quest of haunting requires us
to reckon with both scholarly knowledge and to move towards
a new world built on care, preservation, and remembrance.
Making claims of causality requires us to imagine a world we
don't know based only on the world we do know, which is
forged by the unending march of racial capitalism; perhaps
we can move towards a better world by imagining otherwise.
